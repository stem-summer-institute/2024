## Code Girls United - Free Afterschool Computer Science and Coding Program

An overview of who we are, what we do, and our approach, which includes using computer science and math to foster social-emotional learning. We provide an opportunity for girls to see if they like working with technology, and provide the opportunity to try it out. Girls, 4th â€“ 8th grade, meet weekly after school throughout the year. The first half of the year involves learning the basics of Computer Science. In the second half of the year, the girls split into teams to choose a service project, then complete a business case, and then code their app. The girls then compete in local and national competitions. Code Girls United provides free after-school programs that promote social-emotional learning, career readiness, and tools for self-sufficiency. Through our After-School Coding & Business Program, we help rural and Native girls from low-income areas across Montana improve their social mobility by equipping them with the education and resources they need for future success in STEM-related fields.
