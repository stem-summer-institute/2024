Coming soon!


## Where the wild science is
  
Join Alexandra Isern on an interactive journey through planet Earth. She’ll talk about what it’s like to stand on an ice sheet in Antarctica surrounded by waddling penguins, how best to connect with students on topics like dinosaurs and climate change, and where you can catch captivating auroras in the night sky. In addition to showing off the latest fashion from Antarctica, she’ll also have stickers, posters, and trading cards for the classroom.
