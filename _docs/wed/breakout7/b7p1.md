Come learn about two new educational opportunities for teachers. 

1. Place-based culturally relevant environmental science lessons created by Montana teachers. You can get a stipend to join a group of teachers for professional development and support this upcoming academic year while learning how to engage your students with hands-on lesson plans that feature mysteries and case studies from Montana. 
2. Learn about a NASA robotics showcase in which your students can participate in missions and showcase their work at an event at MSU and possibly win a trip to Kennedy Space Center.
