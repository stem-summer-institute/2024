Wildfire plays a vital role in Montana’s diverse ecosystems but also poses a growing threat to Montana’s health, safety and livelihoods. Join us to learn about a National Science Foundation-supported research and education program to understand and improve the use of prescribed fire across the state of Montana. We will also share the project’s connections to – and educational resources for teaching about –artificial intelligence, machine learning and smart optical sensors. You will go home with tools you can use right away in your classroom.
