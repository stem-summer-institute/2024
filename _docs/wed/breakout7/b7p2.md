For six weeks this summer, eight Montana elementary teachers have been embedded in MSU engineering labs to enhance their teaching of science, technology, engineering and math while also considering how to integrate STEM with Indian Education for All. The overall theme of the program is energy, including biomass; materials for energy conversion systems like fuel cells, batteries, wind turbines and solar cells; and, sustainable infrastructure materials and transportation systems. Come see what they have learned so you can use it in your own classrooms.
