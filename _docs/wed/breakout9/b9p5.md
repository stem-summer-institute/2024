title: Half-Earth Map Design Challenge
permalink: /docs/b9p5/

Attendees will participate in a hands-on mapping design challenge centered on the grand global challenge of saving the Earth's biodiversity. Students are introduced to the principle of Half-Earth, conceived by the late American biologist E.O. Wilson and adopted by a new generation of scientists and conservationists who conclude that we must set aside half of Earth's land and seas for nature to maintain biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of our planet. Using authentic data, students are challenged to consider current land use in the U.S. when identifying land for conservation.
