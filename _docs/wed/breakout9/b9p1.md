We as teachers are overwhelmed with the amount of "stuff" we are required to do on a daily basis. This workshop helps teachers implement design thinking into the curriculum, and resources they're already using.

With a Bachelor’s of Science in Agriculture Education, and over a decade of classroom and professional experience, Amy’s jam is marrying standards to practical life and project based learning. Hailing from the Shark Bite Capital of the World (New Smyrna Beach, FL), the bulk of Amy's experience is in the secondary classroom with a diverse background of students. Her favorite project to date has been surfboard manufacturing with her students, in which students researched subaqueous topography to predict wave patterns in given locations (“surf spots”) and design surfboards suited for those locations using CAD and CNC software.  Projects are the peanut butter to the standards jelly, so let's make a sandwich!
