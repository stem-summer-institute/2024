### Hands on STEAM Activities from the Montana Makers Exhibition
The University of Montana spectrUM Discovery Area is a hands-on science museum in Missoula, MT dedicated to igniting passion for discovery through science. Our Montana Makers exhibition has visited schools around the state, from Dixon to Ft. Benton. In addition to the exhibition, we've worked with a peer learning community of teachers to test and create curriculum for classroom use. This workshop will share some of the STEAM activities and best practices from this project.
