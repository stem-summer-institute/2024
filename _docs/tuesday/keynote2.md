## Obstacles as Opportunities: Viewing the World through the Lens of a Data Scientist

Join Dr. Reinhold as she shares her story of shifting from being an “at-risk” high school truant to co-directing the Software Engineering and Cybersecurity Lab (SECL) at MSU. Reinhold will interweave how her scientific thinking was developed by key teachers and the learning environments that they cultivated, and how these experiences still impact her data-science research today.
