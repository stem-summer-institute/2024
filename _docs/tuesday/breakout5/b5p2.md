### Productive Discussions to Support Students' Sense-making in STEM
While engaging in the science and engineering practices students are simultaneously engaging in productive science conversations that also support the ELA standards and the STEM subjects. Take a deep dive into productive discussions; what are they and when/why to use them. Using the OpenSciEd curriculum come experience specific types of discussions to support studentsâ€™ sense-making journey. Ready-to-use resources include how to set up, facilitate, and nurture a classroom where productive discussions are promoted and sustained.

I am a former middle and high school math and science teacher of 22 years.  I recently joined Activate Learning in 2023 looking for a way to work with educators and promote quality science education from outside of the classroom setting.  I am passionate about 3-dimensional STEM education and student-led science that supports the whole student and drives excitement for engaging in critical thinking.  Born in northern Ohio, I now call rural western North Carolina home with my husband of 21 years and a houseful of rescue pets.
