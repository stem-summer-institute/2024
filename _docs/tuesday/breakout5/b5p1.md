### Econo-Quest: Exploring Global Economics & Careers in Montana
Did you know that Montana has one of the largest photonics industries? Or that our wheat and barley are highly prized by Japan and Taiwan due to the high protein content and sustainable agricultural practices of Montana farms?  During this session, explore Montana’s connection to the world through economics! The Montana World Affairs Council has two signature programs for middle and high school students that focus on international trade and the science of economics.  These programs align with state and national standards, fulfilling requirements for economics education in Montana classrooms. As a participant,  you will learn about these free programs and how to use them in your classroom. The session will guide you through a mini ‘EconoQuest’ where we learn about a country that trades with Montana and use math, geography, and science to make trade decisions!
