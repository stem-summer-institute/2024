### Museum of the Rockies Presents...

Come learn how the Museum of the Rockies can be used in and outside of the classroom. MOR is dedicated to engaging all learners, from babies to adults who are young at heart, in explorations of science, history, and art through an array of educational programs. From our founding in 1957, we have shared the museum’s collections with the public, engaging visitors through special events, programs, and outreach materials. Thanks to the Opening Doors for Montana Schoolchildren fund, we are able to offer free admission for all Montana schools. As a community resource and regional museum, MOR’s education team encourages curiosity for people of all ages.
