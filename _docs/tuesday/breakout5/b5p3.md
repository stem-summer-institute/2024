### Explore at MOR!

There are so many ways for schools to get involved in programming at Museum of the Rockies! From virtual programming, to traveling outreach kits, to a variety of in-person field trip resources, learn more about all of MOR's opportunities to engage in object- and place-based learning that is centered on space, history, native culture, and the ecology of the Northern Rockies (not to mention, whatever exciting exhibit on offer in our rotating exhibit halls!). Learn how Montana schools can receive free museum admission and get partially or fully reimbursed for their transportation costs, as a part of the funding offered through the Opening Doors for Montana Schoolchildren Fund. We'll also touch base on how to make your visit run as smoothly as possible and briefly discuss plans to increase offerings for preschools. Can't wait to see you there!

Shannon Werbeach is the Youth and School Programs Manager at Museum of the Rockies. Originally from Northeast Ohio, Shannon attended Ohio State University to study Philosophy and Geography. She then pursued a graduate education in Geography at the University of Minnesota, before heading to North Carolina to study to become a park ranger and wilderness EMT. She first moved out west to accept a position as the Work Director of the Yellowstone Youth Conservation Corps, based out of the Mammoth Hot Springs duty station of the park. She remained there until 2023, heading up the YCC in the summer and working for Yellowstone as an education ranger during the off seasons. After 1 season in Grand Teton National Park and 5 in Yellowstone, she relocated to Livingston in order to bring her leadership experience, passion for informal education, and knowledge of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem to MOR. She's excited and honored to have the opportunity to introduce teachers to all that MOR has to offer the youth of Montana.
