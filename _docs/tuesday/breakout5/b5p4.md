This interactive discussion will explain what data science is, the different ways it can be implemented in K-12 classrooms, and how educators can integrate it into their existing curriculum. Educators will discover the applicability of data across disciplines, take time to explore lesson ideas, and collaboratively discuss ways to engage their students with data.
