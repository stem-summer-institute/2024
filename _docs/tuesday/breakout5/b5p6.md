### Computing Across the Curriculum

The power of computing has transformed our social, economic, and political spheres. Future citizens of this country should have a basic knowledge of how computers and the internet work to make more informed decisions. And yet, computing is, on the whole, not a part of K-12 education. Sponsored by the American Computer & Robotics Museum in Bozeman, this session will provide concrete, hands-on lessons that can be tied to standards across all academic disciplines. Educators with no experience in computing will feel at ease with these project-based activities designed to communicate student knowledge of respective subjects using computing.

Dr. Jake Chipps taught high school computer science and mathematics for 15 years. During that time, he built a computer science department that served 20 students in 2010 and now serves over 1,000 students per year. He co-wrote the California State Computer Science Standards, developed nation-wide curricula and professional development modules, and has coached computer science teachers across the US. Jake earned his doctorate studying the experiences and perceptions of K-12 teachers who use computer science as a classroom tool in non-CS classes. Jake's work at MSU includes developing curriculum that combines physical computing with IEFA and teaching in the School of Computing, Department of Mathematical Sciences, and the Department of Education. Jake is now the Program Director at the American Computer & Robotics Museum where he develops educational programs designed to expose more Montana citizens to computing.
