### Computing Across the Curriculum

The power of computing has transformed our social, economic, and political spheres. Future citizens of this country should have a basic knowledge of how computers and the internet work to make more informed decisions. And yet, computing is, on the whole, not a part of K-12 education. Sponsored by the American Computer & Robotics Museum in Bozeman, this session will provide concrete, hands-on lessons that can be tied to standards across all academic disciplines. Educators with no experience in computing will feel at ease with these project-based activities designed to communicate student knowledge of respective subjects using computing.
