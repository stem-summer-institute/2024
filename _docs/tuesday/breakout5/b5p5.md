### Sensemaking Strategies in the Science Classroom

A critical component of any science lesson is the opportunity for students to make sense of their experiences. After a brief hands-on lesson, engage in sensemaking yourself and leave with clear strategies to use in your classroom for the start of the school year. We will raffle off a set of sensemaking posters.
