In this lesson, students solve a mystery of the decimation of the ecosystem in Flathead Lake, Montana, by analyzing data and articles to determine the ecological relationships between organisms. Once the determine the cause of the disruption to be the invasive species of Opossum shrimp, introduced as a potential prey species that outcompeted the native zooplankton and fish, students design a solution to solve the problem. This lesson was developed into a ready-made unit by Linda Rost in partnership with the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation.
