permalink: /docs/b3p2/

This make and take workshop will discuss bringing culture into a math class - how can you intertwine Social Studies, IEFA, and math? Participants will use their creativity and attention to detail in finding answers and solutions to challenges such as why structures can fail, what are weak points?  We will look at various buildings and structures, compare and contrast past to present.  Participants will take away shapes and ideas for lesson plans incorporating areas of the curriculum.
