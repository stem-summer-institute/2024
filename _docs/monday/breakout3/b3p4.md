In this session, educators will learn about tools like ArcGIS and Nat Geo MapMaker to use as mapping resources when engaging in field trip activities (or to take/make a virtual field trip). Whether the field trip is to a museum or a park, educators will learn about tools that can integrate citizen science activities to add to their journey!
