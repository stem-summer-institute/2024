permalink: /docs/b3p5/
---

In this session, participants will engage in a live macroinvertebrate sample! Background information including how aquatic macroinvertebrates indicate stream health and how to collect your own sample will be part of the session. The session will focus on how the study of macroinvertebrates creates connections between science content and our environment. Help your students connect to the outdoors and understand environmental health with hands-on inquiry!
