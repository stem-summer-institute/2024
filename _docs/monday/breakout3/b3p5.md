title: Aquatic Macroinvertebrates - Indicators of Montana Stream Health
permalink: /docs/b3p5/
---

In this session, participants will engage in a live macroinvertebrate sample! Background information including how aquatic macroinvertebrates indicate stream health and how to collect your own sample will be part of the session. The session will focus on how the study of macroinvertebrates creates connections between science content and our environment. Help your students connect to the outdoors and understand environmental health with hands-on inquiry!

*Field Coordinator, Ripple: The Center for Education & Ecosystem Studies*

I was born and raised in Butte, MT, a town built on mining that started in the 1860s. I continued my education at Montana Tech, obtaining my bachelor's in Organismal Biology in the fall of 2019. During this time, I would intern with Ripple, where my love of environmental science would begin. I got a full-time position with Ripple in the spring of 2021 in the position I reside in now. This position encouraged me to start a master's program at Montana State University focusing on Land Resources and Environmental Sciences in the fall of 2022. Within my position with Ripple, I travel to schools in the Clark Fork Watershed above Missoula and administer several environmental education programs. All these programs are based on placed-based environmental focuses within our superfund and surrounding areas. Having a program created from the superfund actions and operating within one of the largest superfunds in the United States. This creates many opportunities for environmental education and awareness opportunities.
