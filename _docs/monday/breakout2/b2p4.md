Caregiver attitudes towards STEM can strengthen youth engagement and perceptions of STEM learning. Join the Montana Afterschool Alliance to discuss research-based approaches for involving families in STEM education and supporting their child's learning journey. Drawing from practical experiences of the Institute for the Study of Resilience in Youth at McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School, we will present the STEM Family Engagement Planning Tool, hear from the field, and explore activities from Montana-based programs.
