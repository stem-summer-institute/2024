The Lift Off Summer Institute is a week-long training program for K-12 educators at Johnson Space Center. This year’s theme is “Growing on Earth and Beyond.” The training will focus on the role plants will play in extended space missions. The presentation will be a first hand account of the training from a Montana teacher that attended. Lessons and resources will be shared as well as how to apply for this opportunity sponsored by the Montana Space Grant Consortium.
