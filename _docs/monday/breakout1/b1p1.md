Maybe you’ve heard the word quantum but have no idea what it means in the context of Montana’s growing industry. Then this presentation is for you! Quantum has the capacity to change everything around us – a revolution similar to the arrival of the World Wide Web or the invention of the radio and television, and this may be the biggest growing industry in Montana you know nothing about. We will share an overview of quantum science and technologies with key concepts for learning, as well as some ready-to-go activities that you can take home and use with your students to educate and interest them in the many careers Quantum offers.
